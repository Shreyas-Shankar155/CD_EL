Problem Statement 1: Analyzing Cyclomatic Complexity  

Analysis of the IR code generated by CLANG front-end is performed.  

To trigger the functionality, copy the LLVM repo from https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project.  
Checkout to Release/14.x  
Then replace the llvm directory within the cloned git repo with the llvm repo present in this project.  

To trigger functionality, type: clang <input_file.c> -mllvm -analyze-Cyclomatic  

The cyclomatic functionality will be performed per function and output will be written to output.txt.
